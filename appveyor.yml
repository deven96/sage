# Rust needs at least Visual Studio 2013 image to build the MSVC targets.
image:
  - Visual Studio 2019
  # TODO: Add support for UUbuntu and macOS images.
  # - Ubuntu
  # - macOS

# This configuration will setup a build for each channel & target combination
# (8 windows combinations in all). You can add the `beta` channel to make all
# combinations. There are 2 channels here: stable and nightly.
#
# Alternatively, the full version may be specified for the channel to build
# using that specific version (e.g. channel: 1.5.0).
#
# The values for target are the set of windows Rust build targets.
# Each value is of the form:
#
# `ARCH-pc-windows-TOOLCHAIN`
#
# Where `ARCH` is the target architecture, either `x86_64` or `i686`, and
# `TOOLCHAIN` is the linker toolchain to use, either `msvc` or `gnu`.
#
# See <https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html#win-foot> for a description of
# the toolchain differences.
#
# See <https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/#toolchain-specification>
# for description of toolchains and host triples.

# This is the most important part of the Appveyor configuration. This installs
# the version of Rust specified by the `channel` and `target` environment
# variables from the "build matrix". This uses rustup to install Rust.
#
# For simple configurations, instead of using the build matrix, you can simply
# set the `default-toolchain` and `default-host` manually here.

  - set PATH=%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin
  - rustc -vV
  - cargo -vV

# See Appveyor documentation for specific details. In short, place any `channel`
# or `targets` you wish to allow build failures on (usually `nightly` at least
# is a wise choice). This will prevent a build or test failure in the matching
# channels/targets from failing the entire build.

# `cargo test` takes care of building for us, so disable Appveyor's build stage.

# Uses `cargo test` to run tests and build. Alternatively, the project may call
# compiled programs directly or perform other testing commands. Rust will
